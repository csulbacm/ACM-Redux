// Title: Project_Charter_VA_Memory_Test.md
ï»¿## Project Name
Veterans Affairs Memory Test Project

## Project Manager
Bernandina Ortiz

## Project Definition
	Develop a memory test program that will test the patients memory to determine if their memory has been impaired. The program will test the patient's memory by displaying a colored shape for two seconds, then showing a blank screen for five, ten, or fifteen seconds, then showing four shapes in which the patient must select the one he/she saw in the beginning.

## Project Scope
IT Medical Services.

## Project Goals
Provide a user-friendly test program that uses a portable programming language (Java) for virtually any operating system.

## Project Dependencies
	- Implement transitions from one trial to another.
	- Implement transitions from one stage to another.
	- Implement the creation and deletion of the shapes.
	- Implement file writing to gather all data from each stage, including the emergency stage
	- Implement both normal and emergency tests.
	- Implement sounds.
	- Implement objects that calculate and stores the test results and the patient's information.
	- Implement a timer to transition the trials and stages as well as keep track of how it takes for the patient to answer each trial.
	- Implement means of getting the patient's personal information (name and age) with a dummy- proof system in place.
