﻿# BOT OF THUNDER

## PROJECT MANAGER
Frank Lima


## PROJECT DEFINITION
THOR is a mobile Tesla bot, it is a radio controlled vehicle that has the capability of harnessing thousands of volts of electricity as well as RF jamming.  The machine will also contain a researched Mobile Tesla Technology also known as M.T.T


## PROJECT SCOPE
THOR (Tesla Bot) must be able to produce over 6,000 volts of electricity as well as anywhere from 300 – 1,000 watts of power.  The purpose of the machine is to have the ability to carry large amounts of wattage and voltage in a manageable mobile unit.  The technology that will be produced will be called MTT (Mobile Tesla Technology).


## PROJECT GOALS
1. To create a functioning Tesla coil with a reach of 1.00 – 1.50ft of electrical distance.
2. Have the machine able to carry its components lightly enough so that the machine may be able to move
3. Design the machine in such a way that if the Tesla coil engages, no damaged is incurred onto the machine's internal components


## PROJECT DEPENDENCIES
None


## PROJECT TEAM
	1. Frank Lima
	2. Nathan Pickrell
	3. David Nuon
	4. James Coolidge


## PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS
None


## PROJECT PHASES
	1. Create a functioning Tesla coil with stable voltage, capacitance and wattage
	2. merge the tesla coil with the robot's chassis
	3. construct the remaining chassis for the robot around the Tesla coil's internal components
	4. shield the internal components of the chassis with a Faraday Cage
	5. Test the components as a whole and debug any possible interference issues


## PROJECT TIMELINE
1. 02 – 18 – 12  to 02 – 19 – 12
	1. Setup windings, coils, transformers and capacitance for the initial stage of the Tesla coil. Ran voltage tests
	2. Began construction of the robotic frame (with many issues)
1. 02 – 25 – 12
	1. Create salt water capacitor jars with a rack to increase voltage, to increase the spark gap needed to power the Tesla coil
	2. Find a hollow globe for the Tesla coil's emitter
1. 03 – 03 – 12
	1. Begin cutting out a steel frame for THOR and finding appropriate drive train equipment to drive the motors of the machine
1. 03 – 10 – 12
	1. Place Tesla equipment into THOR's frame and measure output range to find appropriate inverter, create a relay switch for the inverter to fire off the Tesla coil at user's command (as well as a manual safety in case of emergency).
1. 03 – 17- 12
	1. Shield sensitive RF components, seal machine and test
- TIME line subject to change at project manager's discretion for availability


## PROJECT CHALLENGES
	1. MTT could severely damage its own components due to EMI throwback, proper shielding is necessary to allow the machine to function
	1. The size in which the final robot may be an issue.  Most parts for the machine are large due to conversion, such as DC/AC conversion as well as large capacitors, also to enable the machine to have a low-slope advantage.
	1. Grounding is the largest issue as of (02-16-12), if the device is not properly grounded, the 6,000volt transformer will severely damage itself as well as other components due to EMI throwback.


## PROJECT FINANCES
	1. Armor - $60
	2. Tesla Parts- $40
	3. Gearboxes - $30
	4. Misc- $20
	- TOTAL:  $150	
	- All further finances for the machine will be covered by the project manager.


## PROJECT ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME
The project should be completed no later than the next E-Week event put on by EAT and their robotics competition.


## PROJECT STATUS
In progress
