Code Jams are a weekly event hosted to get people together and just start coding. Itâ€™s also an excellent place to search for help on any coding projects you might be working on. Keep in mind though that the main purpose is to get something done.

Hack-a-thons are week long competitions where participants can create an app. Employers send scouters to these competitions. Even though you might not win the competition, it is still worthwhile to participate, there is a chance you might be offered a job or internship.
