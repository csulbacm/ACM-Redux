There was a meeting yesterday. There will be a meeting tomorrow. You
can earn $10,000 if you come up with a design and business plan that
really impressed them; Electrical Motor bike won last year! They'll
give you connections to start up your own company</li><ol><li>Ariana: Scope?</li><ol><li>Sal: Within Cal State Long beach.</li><ol><li>Karan: Others can participate.</li></ol></ol></ol></ol>
</ol>
<li>New Business&nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li>New Project - Augmented Ebay</li><ol><li>Karan: Ebay Sellers do not
have a tool to put up multiple pictures and videos on their website.
You have to pay ebay. Ebay does not provide a rich multimedia listing.
It will provide a mobile user with an interface so that he can upload
more than one video/picture along with files into his ebay listing. It
will be in a rich HTML format. This will be developed using Sencia and
PhoneGap. I will be using my own server space...to host the database
where people can host everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Sal: That 40 hour estimate seems low. 100 hours sounds right...maybe an underestimate.</li><ol><li>Karan: I equated the number of hours in classes.</li><ol><li>Alex: Right now it's unknown whether it's 40 or 100 hours.&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Sal:
we'll pass this as a draft; we're in a preliminary state that's ironing
out the scope. Then we'll have it as an official project. We can
reserve a room and publicize.</li></ol></ol></ol><ol><li>Karan:
We'll have a free and pro version. Free is unlimited for 12 pictures.
One webpage...will be visable and compiled to phone technologies.&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Nate: You seem to be shooting a little high but I've seen [your work]...so I believe you. Haha!</li></ol></ol><li>Sal: Where do we plan to go after you pass it as a draft?</li><ol><li>Karan: We have already started developing it.</li><ol><li>Sal:
We can put up flyers and get feedback; we can help build up your team.
Once you have the scope set then we can pass it as an official project.</li></ol></ol></ol><li>Karan:
We need to make the spending plan as well as the $10,000 [reward].
Right now, I want to enter the market for software, recruit revenue for
hardware then branch out with [a company]. Someone in the audience
stole my idea...they are my competition.&nbsp;</li><li>Karan: $90 draft protection</li><li>Movement - [Sal/Ariana] Move to project as a draft -&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">[PASSED]</span></li><ol><li>Sal - He will become a voting member but not an officer after pass.</li><li>Ariana: Good luck. I'm not being sarcastic.</li></ol></ol><li>IBM Mainframe Competition.</li><ol><li>Nate: As a lot of people know, I work for IBM. They are holding a competition for mainframes; basically you
write software for a cluster of 96 mainframes remotely. Free entry;
$35,000 worth of prizes. It's a [different programming aspect which] I
don't find difficult. If you want to participate, you can add it as a
bullet...on your resume.</li><li>Nate: Mainframes are [NOT] dead.
Competition is around the Spring. There are prizes to be had. Requires
code for performance over interface; it's a cluster of a lot of power
servers running an application as fast as possible. Please contact chair@csulb.acm.org; I"m the one forming the team.</li><ol><li>Donald: Language?</li><ol><li>Nate: This is mainframe. This is new.&nbsp;</li></ol><li>Andrew: Is there documentation?</li><ol><li>Nate: Yes. Alex: IBM has good documentation.</li><ol><li>Andrew: But they're not a software company.</li><ol><li>Nate:
they're a SERVICE company. The operating system is ZOS. You can run
linux on it; called ZLinux. The competition is not using ZLinux.</li></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol><li>Fire
Hazard - Mr. John Mcllrath (Room 115) wants the organization to address
the issue of dangling extension cords in the ACM Office. Non-surge
protected power strips are prohibited as well. He stopped by at 11:20
AM.</li><ol><li>Frank: I would like to take care of the situation.</li><ol><li>Nate: Please don't use the power efficient power strips.</li><ol><li>Frank: I would like to lead it and take care of teh situation.</li><ol><li>Joshua: Thank you very much Mr. Viceroy.</li></ol></ol></ol></ol>

<li>ADJOURNMENT
<ol>
<li>Closing Comments</li><ol><li>Sal: You guys ever had the Senator for the CoE has stepped down?
Jake Rice didn't have time to do it; two meetings a week. He's not a
sophmore anymore. If you want to be a Senator; meetings every
Wednesday. There have been a few fillabusters. You will meet a lot of
people and you will learn a lot while having a say. ASI has tried to
raise fees and it's CoE that fights to the nail to stop ASI from
[overspending]. If you're intersted, please apply.</li><ol><li>Nate: How soon do we have to fill the position?</li><ol><li>Sal: Email by tomorrow (president@aesb.org).</li><ol><li>Ariana: There may be a form at AESB.org</li></ol></ol></ol></ol><li>Frank: Whoever is last in the ACM room, please put the sign away when you leave.&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Sal: We have you on tape!</li><ol><li>Nate: I did that once. Sorry!</li><ol><li>Frank: Thanks</li></ol></ol></ol><li>Sal: Are we ever going to set up office hours?</li><ol><li>Nate: I will need to find someone...</li><ol><li>Sal: who has the key?</li><ol><li>Nate: Technically, only the executive officers.</li><ol><li>Sal: Post a sign [stating availability].&nbsp;</li></ol></ol></ol><li>Frank: Lets set up a google docs in our mail system and find the overlap. We will post there...</li><ol><li>Nate: There are blind spots that the four of us can't cover.</li><ol><li>Ariana: We're working on getting ACM-W excecutive officers keys.&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Nate: Is Mike Berg trying to stonewall you guys?</li><ol><li>Ariana: No, he just has to pick up the keys.</li><ol><li>Nate: Oh, the [hard part is finding] Mike Berg.&nbsp;</li></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol><li>Frank: Good luck on Midterms!</li></ol>
