</ol>
<li>Publicity &amp; Recruitment Chair:</li>
<ol>
<li>Spring Recruitment Program:</li><ol><li>Sal: Guys, this is
important. I'm not sure you noticed but all the officers are seniors.
Unless we find people to join us, the org will die. What I'm thinking
is that the issue with our meetings is that it's too much...and people
leave. One goes out the classroom [with ACM-W] and we would have our
normal meetings and once every two weeks we have an advising meeting
for [informal android/game programming].</li><ol><li>Andrew: We may have trouble getting other people for the second part.</li></ol><li>Sal: ESRA and AIAA says it's really useful.
This is going to be a massive push. Next week we'll set up an advising
committee. We just need to decide when to have it. [our current
meetings] are productive but not friendly.</li></ol>
</ol>
<ol>
</ol>
<li>Market Manager:&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Increase in sales. Ritz Crackers
has just went out of stock. Mars candy box with Twix, Skittles, Snickers
and Milky Way has sold out. Green Tea and Vitamin Water is doing well;
everything else will [make it to] the end of the week. Anything else to
stock?</li><ol><li>Sal: Energy Drinks</li><ol><li>James: One case for monster is $32.&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Sal/Andrew: How much Profit?</li><ol><li>James: $18.&nbsp;</li></ol></ol></ol><li>Derrik: Protein Bars!</li><ol><li>Donald Herman: We should be able to buy them online for $1 and sell for $2.&nbsp;</li><ol><li>James:
They [both] have long shelf lives. Chips are unknown. Most everything
in there is shelf-stable; especially the Ramen.&nbsp;</li></ol></ol></ol><li>Windows 8:&nbsp;</li><ol><li>We
are wanting to put this on this coming semester. With 8 beta being
released this winter, [we can package it with windows 7 and] make an
event [with Bob.] We're going to be shorthanded and need man/women
power. I need volunteers to have a decent amount of free time next
semester since it is going to be a large undertaking. We are going to
do this in the auditorium. We're going to need it hammered out on
because
in order to get mark to come we are going to have the reservation/paln
and &nbsp;this all done well before the &nbsp;event. This needs to be a
plan that is started towards the end of the semester and finished over
the second week of January.&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Sal: Thing about reserving the room; if you're using the beach auditorum; for E-week it was going to be completely booked.</li><ol><li>James: They can't&nbsp;book through everything. You're welcome to collaborate thru skype...</li><ol><li>Sal: Just say free food and we'll come running.</li><ol><li>James: I'm hoping for some volunteers</li><ol><li>Ariana: *raise&nbsp;hand. I'll mention it to the ACM-W meeting.&nbsp;</li><li>Sal: I can make flyers and provide advice.</li></ol></ol></ol><li>Karan: Flyers for [upper campus]?</li><ol><li>James: Upper campus [people cannot get this product unless they are STEM]</li></ol><li>Andrew: Are we going to rent for the auditorum?</li><ol><li>James: Yes. </li></ol></ol><li>Ariana: Windows 7/8 keys thru MSDNAA?</li><ol><li>James:
Non-students and STEM Students can get a copy. This is a fest for
[launching Windows 8] and getting everyone excited about it. It [can be
something that] Microsoft would [sponsor as an official event].&nbsp;</li></ol><li>Karan: How long will this take?</li><ol><li>James: It will take all day; [starting at 8].</li><ol><li>Karan: how about planning?</li><ol><li>James:
We need to get the bare bones; what would it take to get the event
established. We'd like a date by the end of this year; chartering the
manifest for hte auditorum. I want to start advertising by early
January- mid February.&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Sal: In the middle of E-Week...</li><ol><li>James: the actual event won't take palce until the end of this week.</li></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol><li>Sal: You can't be a liberal artist here?</li><ol><li>James: Yeah.</li><ol><li>Sal: If we want a ton of money....</li><ol><li>James: We're limited to [the number of people that can fit] with a Early CD Key.</li><ol><li>Sal: So you're saying an early and high demand key...</li></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol><ol><li>Nate: Lost contact with Stoke... Since we can't log in; we can't add new accounts to MSDNAA.&nbsp;</li></ol><li>James: Email me if you would like to follow up at the EAT email account.</li></ol></ol>
<li>Membership Chair:</li>
<ol>
<li>Alumni List*:</li><ol><li>Donald: If you're going to graduate, please send me an email. I'm going to change up some stuff. I'll get to it this weekend.</li></ol><li>Donald: I would like someone put the ebay project charter in the dropbox.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<li>Webmasters:&nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li>Agendas and Minutes on Websites:&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Escobar: They are a couple weeks behind.</li></ol>
<li>Project Pages on Websites:</li><ol><li>Escobar: Lynn has filled me out on how to update the website. </li></ol>
</ol>
<li>Open Positions are available!</li><ol><li>Sal: We'll focus on that next semseter.</li></ol>
</ol>
</li>
<ol>
</ol>
<li>Project/Committee Reports<span style="font-style: italic;">:<br />
</span>
<ol>
<li>Augmented Ebay Project:</li><ol><li>Karan: We managed to send our
first listing to ebay.com. Now we are planning to make Sentia talk to
ASP.NET and the mobile app will now send the listing to ebay.com And
then we have to integrate the .NET to Sentia. One more month to finish
it and it will be up and running by January.</li><ol><li>Nate: Is that enough time to enter the competition</li><ol><li>Karan:
In Feb, we write the marketing strategy. In the month of April, we will
have a family for the CA Innovation challenge; they will take four
teams.&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Ariana: So you're...ahead of schedule.</li><li>Nate: Where is the compeittion?</li><ol><li>Karan: At the pyramid.</li></ol><li>Sal: If you need help with [monkey design, we have contacts].</li><ol><li>Karan: Our monkey was [already] designed by someone from the design department.</li></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Boeing Project:&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Andrew: next week everything is
due and we'll merge everything together. In theory it will be done and
the ACM part's done if everything is done correctly. I'll give out grades to all the groups.</li></ol>
<li>Chess Engine Project (Draft):</li><ol><li>Stoner: I have someone working on it so I didn't do anything with it. We could drop it or continue it later.</li><ol><li>Sal:
After you graduate you cannot be a voting member. You have to be in
college to vote in matters but nothing in our bylaws say anything
[against working in the project as a graduate].&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Stoner: I'll be still around.</li><ol><li>Sal: If you want to be an Alumni Advisor...</li><li>Nate: Don't move to San Diego.</li></ol></ol></ol></ol>
<li>Programming Team:<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;</span></span></li>
<ol>
<li>Post-Competition Report:&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Sal: We got Lynn, Tony and Rodrigo at 14th place.</li><ol><li>Andrew: Rodrigo's the math guy right? Did he do well?</li><ol><li>Tony: Yeah.</li></ol><li>Nate: How did you do so well?</li><ol><li>Tony: We learned all the algorithms a day before.&nbsp;</li><li>Karan: [It's really tough].</li></ol><li>Nate: I was going to suggest to take 528 but it's too late.</li><ol><li>Sal: Talk to Lynn; she has a year to go.</li><li>Tony: We are attending only; not in the class.</li></ol></ol></ol>
<li>New Practice Techniques:</li><ol><li>Sal: So just out of chance, I
saw that USC's team were the first to complete it in the first couple
of years. They study hardcore and gave me a couple tips; MIT and
Stanford have their own practice software with open source and full
solutions. We often don't know how to solve [our own] problems. We
haven't been using this tool that has been on there forever:
onlinejudge; an online version of the ICPC. They are like full on problems.&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Nate:
In theory it isn't difficult to do well; we just have to keep on
grinding thru the practice problems until you mastered pretty much
everything. I think it's possible though; what's his face did it?
Kevin, Mark and [some girl]. </li></ol></ol>
<li>Photos:&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Sal: Ariana. Status on the photos?</li><ol><li>Ariana: I have them. If I can put them on a flashdrive and give it to you [Sal] that would be fine.</li><ol><li>Sal: Great.</li></ol></ol></ol>
<li>Contact with Kevin:</li><ol><li>Sal: Unfortunately, Frank isn't here. I was hoping he would contact Kevin.&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Nate: What for?</li><ol><li>Sal: For advice</li><ol><li>Nate:
He's going to say the exact same thing; They train five hours every
month and three weeks in advance they grinded. They won by grinding.</li><ol><li>Andrew: Brute Force.&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Sal: He works at Google now. How valuable it would be to have a thing at Google. </li></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol>
</ol>
<li>Socie-D:&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Donald: We have thousands of characters in the screen at the same time; hopefully we can integrate it with Josh's camera class.</li><ol><li>Nate: I'd like to see [what you're doing]</li><ol><li>Donald: 5:00 PM today!</li></ol></ol></ol>
<li>Untitled ImagineCup Project:</li><ol><li>Donald: We're starting out
with a 2D game but now we have a new member of the group who wants to
do a 3D game that has experience so we're going in that direction and
made Physics Engines before. We're still working on it.</li><ol><li>Sal: When do you expect to turn in the project into a full project?</li><ol><li>Donald: I'll give it to Josh this week.</li></ol></ol></ol>
<li>Women in Computing Startup:&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Ariana; We have our
ALICE workshop at Lakewood high school and it's going to be a little
awkward but we're going to make it work.&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Nate: How so?</li><ol><li>Ariana:
There's a section of computers but there's also a section for
individual desks and the projector [and lab is far apart]. The walls
are light blue so [the projector] may wash out. I opened up a new
account for an ASI bank account since the other one was screwed up. It
was a little bit of a hassle...</li><ol><li>Andrew: They renamed it and tried to take it away since we haven't used it in a while.</li><ol><li>Ariana: It's an entirely new [not sub] account for ACM-W</li></ol></ol></ol></ol><li>Nate: The flash drives are done.&nbsp;</li><li>Ariana: All the grants are for just this one...</li><ol><li>Andrew: any other things to spend for?</li><ol><li>Ariana: For ACM-W? Not yet. I make sure that all the receipts are kept. the T-shirts will be ordered soon.</li></ol></ol></ol>
<li>Links For Good:&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Ariana: Some progress. It's
difficult when we go and meet only once a week. I think last week or
the week before I started on some documentation [and] doing it the
right way. Incomplete but a work in progress.</li></ol>
</ol>
</li>
<ol>
</ol>
<li>Event/Fundraising Reports:&nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li>ACM Regional Events: </li><ol><li>Sal :I'm trying to organize a
regional event. It turns out we can get them to the Windows 7 fest then
I'll send out an email after finals for planning. I don't want to do anything huge.</li></ol>
</ol>
<li>Old Business - &nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li>Printer (Ariana volunteered to put on
Craigslist):&nbsp;</li><ol><li>Ariana:
I've had the printer for a week and a half. It was flagged for removal
for suspicious activity since it was brand new. There was a post about
returning it for a full refund.</li><ol><li>Donald: It was probably your competitor that flagged it. </li></ol></ol>
</ol>
<li>New Business - &nbsp;None</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>ADJOURNMENT [1:55 PM]
<ol>
<li>Closing Comments<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></li><ol><li>Sal: If you have any [business] then we're going to be taking a <span style="font-weight: bold;">group photo</span> at the end of the meeting.</li><ol><li>Ariana: I'll bring my camera.</li></ol></ol>
