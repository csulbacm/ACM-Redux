<li>Hiatus      – The charter team is currently unable to currently work on the project.      The charter managers no longer have officer status through the charter.      However, the charter managers and team retain their voting membership      through the charter.</li>
<li>Suspended      – The charter team has failed to show reasonable progress on their charter      or has misused ACM resources. The charter team no longer has voting      membership. The charter managers retain their voting membership so they      may defend their charter. The charter no longer has good standing.</li>

<li>Revoked      – The charter team has misused ACM resources and/or has failed to show      adequate progress. Charter managers are no longer officers through the      charter and charter team members no longer have voting membership through      the charter.</li>
