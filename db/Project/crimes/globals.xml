		       <p>You have grown tried of the hungry, staving, those without medical care; being ignored by your friends, family and those in charge of society.  You have taken it upon yourself to use the technology you have available to stop the “Crimes Against Humanity”. Specific problems the players address are Hunger, Lack of Education, sickness, lack of maternal health and HIV/AIDS. Players must purchase resources and redistribute them throughout the city before the people perish.</p>
